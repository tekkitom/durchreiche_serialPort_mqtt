= Thread Safety

== Single Threaded

You can call both asynchronous (async) and synchronous (sync) APIs without any special precautions.

== Multi-threaded

All distinct objects are not thread-safe. To access shared `client` and/or `endpoint` objects, construct them with a strand-wrapped executor for the underlying layer's argument. The `async_*` member functions of `client` and `endpoint` will dispatch to the executor. As a result of the strand's effect, your asynchronous processes will be serialized.

The following synchronous member functions are accessed directly. Therefore, you need to introduce locks or explicitly dispatch to the executor.
