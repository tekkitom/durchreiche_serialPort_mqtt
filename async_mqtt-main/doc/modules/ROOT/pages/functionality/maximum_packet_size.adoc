= Maximum Packet Size


The Maximum Packet Size is a way to control the size of all packets. If a node sends a packet larger than the Maximum Packet Size, it is considered a protocol error. The counterpart disconnects the connection with a DISCONNECT packet with Reason Code 0x95 (Packet too large).

== Notifying Maximum Packet Size


There are two independent Maximum Packet Size limits.
